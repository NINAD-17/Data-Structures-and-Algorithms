# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains my solutions to various problems related to data structures and algorithms. The problems are organized by topic, with each topic having its own folder. For example, problems related to arrays can be found in the `Arrays` folder.

## Topics
- Basic (conversion of number systems such as octal to binary, binary to decimal, typecasting, fibonacci series, -ve number to binary......)
- Arrays (linear search, binary search problems, sorting)
- Strings
